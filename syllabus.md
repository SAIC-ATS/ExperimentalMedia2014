### Course Description
Experimental Media introduces graduate students to the basic strategies and techniques associated with using experimental media such as robotics, microcontrollers, networked objects, and basic interactivity.

### Course Goals
In concert with the Grad Digital Media Seminar, this course aims to equip new graduate students with foundational tools, techniques and technologies essential to a successful graduate career in Art and Technology Studies.  In addition to school fabrication resources, students will be introduced to a variety of contemporary techniques, practices and creative methodologies.

__Key goals include:__

- Working knowledge of contemporary creative coding tools, with intermediate skills in one or more
- Working knowledge of contemporary creative hardware tools, with intermediate skills in one or more
- Working knowledge of and hands-on exposure to the school’s various fabrication facilities
- Working knowledge of popular online resources for:
  - Materials
  - Electronics
  - Hardware
- Working knowledge of contemporary artists and groups addressing issues related to art and technology
- Working knowledge of intermediate linux/unix OS features (scripting, terminal, automation, etc)
- Building camaraderie between first year students and their classmates.

### Methodology
Using individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual desk critiques, students will experience multiple aspects of interactive design.  Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

### Assignments
The course may include workshops and several small projects, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written online responses, technical research and outings.

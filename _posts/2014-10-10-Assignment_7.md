1. Read [Intro to Graphics](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/intro_to_graphics/chapter.md) by our very own Mike Hadley.  We will be covering some of this in class and you will use some of the concepts in this week's assignment.
1. Continue expanding last week's multiple analog input assignment based on what we covered in class.  Use multiple analog inputs from the Arduino to manipulate text or images.  Be creative!  Try using an alternate analog sensor like a light sensor or a bend sensor (you can get them in the SAIC CRIT vending machines on the 8th floor ...)
    - To use images and text, you'll need to add these "assets" to your Sketch.  You can add images and fonts (*.ttf) fonts pressing the paperclip icon in ofSketch and selecting your assets for upload.  This will copy them into the `bin/data` folder inside of your project's folder (if you are clever, you can also just manually copy them there by digging in the bin folder next to your `ofSketch.app`).
    - To load fonts, you'll need to research the `ofTrueTypeFont` object.
    - To load images, you'll need to research the `ofImage` object.
    - Examples for both can be found in the Week 8 folder of the repository.
    - To use them, drag them into the `data/Projects` folder in your ofSketch folder.  Then start ofSketch and open them there.

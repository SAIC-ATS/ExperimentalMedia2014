1. Install!
	- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
		- OSX: Install the latest version of XCode from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).
		- Other platforms: We will talk about this in class.	
	- Arduino ([latest version](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)) 
	- Processing ([latest version](http://processing.org/download/)) 
		- _Why?! We may occasionally cross-reference our oF work with Processing._
	- Fritzing ([latest version](http://fritzing.org/download/)) 
	- Git (follow the instructions for your platform here: [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. Sign up!
	- Sign up for [http://github.com](http://github.com).  Just get a free account.
	- Sign up for an account at [http://talk.olab.io](http://talk.olab.io).
3. Set up!
	- Read chapter 11 _Version control with Git
_ of [ofBook](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/releases/download/0.2.0/ofBook.pdf).
	- The goal of this week is to come prepared to work with "Git".  We will be using git extensively in the class to share code, make blog posts, and and leave feedback for each other.  Git is used extensively in the creative coding community, and is an extremely useful tool to understand.
	- To begin, follow [this setup guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for your platform.
	- Next, please "fork" the class repository (found [here](https://github.com/bakercp/ExperimentalMedia2014)).  To learn more about "forking" a repository, read [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).  (Basically, it's as easy as pressing the "Fork" button once you have signed up for github).
	- Advanced (Easy if you've used git!  Not so easy if you haven't ... don't worry, we'll go over this in class)
		- Clone your fork to your local computer.
		- Check out the "gh-pages" branch of the repository in your fork (This branch holds our class website).
		- Add yourself to the `members.yml` list (found [here](https://github.com/bakercp/ExperimentalMedia2014/blob/gh-pages/_data/members.yml)) -- just use the same format that I used for my name and info.
		- Write a blog post by adding a [file like this](https://github.com/bakercp/ExperimentalMedia2014/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2014-08-25-ChristopherBaker.md).
4. Check out the following artists.  Come prepared to present one of their projects that inspires you:
	- [http://kylemcdonald.net/](http://kylemcdonald.net/)
	- [http://lauren-mccarthy.com/](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/)
	- [http://www.gravitytrap.com/](http://www.gravitytrap.com/)
	- [http://daito.ws/](http://daito.ws/)
5. Get Equipment
	- Acquire an Arduino UNO or newer ( in reality older ones with the Atmega 328 or better will be fine).  Arduino UNOs are available in SAIC resale or in the vending machines.  You are welcome to get a newer Arduino (like a Due), but you probably wonâ€™t need it.  That said. the Leonardo is pretty nice since it can emulate USB devices like a keyboard.  If you want advice about which board to get, post your question at [http://talk.olab.io](http://talk.olab.io).

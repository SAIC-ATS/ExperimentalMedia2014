This week, equipped with our examples from class, you are going to dive into chips on your own.  We have a collection of well-documented amazing chips in SAIC Resale.  So it's your job to explore some of those based on your own research interests.  You are expected to come to class with a "demo" to share.  You are also expected to be able to talk about "how it works", so in addition to building the thing, you need to spend some time researching what its capabilities are and how it works.

Pick one of the following:

1.  Control an "high current" load such as a DC light or a DC motor or solenoid using a transistor and your Arduino.  Use a TIP 122 (ELE-10018), TIP 125 (ELE-10784) or Mosfet IRFZ44N (ELE-10780) as a "switch" for your high current load.  Be prepared to talk about what a transistor is and the differences between the 122, 125 and IRFZ44N during your demo.  See this page for more: https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/.  You can also buy solenoids and motors from Resale.  This assignment requires that you create a neat Fritzing Diagram to include in our tutorial repository (please! somebody choose this!).

1. Daisy chain at least 3 shift registers.  You can continue your work with the 74HC595 (8 bit serial in parallel out) (ELE-10782), or you can use the 74HC165 (8 bit parallel in serial out) (ELE-10783).  The 74HC165 will allow you to read in 8 buttons (or other digital input) simultaneously.  You can find a clue for daisy chaining these devices here http://bildr.org/2011/02/74hc595/.  You will also find demo code for both in our ATS repository. https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/tutorials/tree/master/Arduino/ICs.

1. Demonstrate the use of the 74HC4067 (ELE-10787), a 16 channel analog multiplexer.  This chip will allow you to read in _16_ analog inputs (like potentiometers or bend sensors).  http://bildr.org/2011/02/cd74hc4067-arduino/  This assignment requires that you create a neat Fritzing Diagram to include in our tutorial repository (please! somebody choose this!).

1. Demonstrate the use of the L298N (ELE-10781), a full-bridge motor driver.  This can be used to drive DC motors in both directions at different speeds.  Robot anyone?  http://www.robotoid.com/appnotes/circuits-bridges.html for a basic intro.

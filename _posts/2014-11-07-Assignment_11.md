1. Expand `ParticleSystemWithClassExtended` (or `ParticleSystem3D`).
    - Create an additional class (like `SquareParticle` that is drawn differently).
    - Create an additional class that has a different physics behaviors (i.e. it moves differently than the base class).

In both cases, you will create a sub-class.  Use the `SquareParticle` as a model of how to create a sub class.  In both cases, you will create particles in the `void setup()` function (as demonstrated in both examples).

2. Expand `HemmerTwister`.  In addition to reacting to the cursor's position, each item should also react to its distance from the cursor.  Items that are close to the cursors should react differently than objects that are far away.

To calculate the distance you can use the distance formula.  If you don't know what that is, then watch this video:

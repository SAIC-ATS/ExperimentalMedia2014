#### Due Week 5

1.  Read the [C++ Basics chapter](http://www.mikewesthad.com/ExperimentalMedia2014/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) of ofBook.
1.  Render [_Sol LeWittâ€™s 1971 Wall Drawing for the School of the MFA Boston_](http://galleristny.com/2012/10/here-are-the-instructions-for-sol-lewitts-1971-wall-drawing-for-the-school-of-the-mfa-boston/) in openFrameworks.  Save your output as a `.pdf`.  (hint: consider `ofGetWidth()`, `ofGetHeight()`, `ofRandom()`, `ofLine()`, `ofCircle()`, `examples/pdfExample`).
  - Place program in folder `ExperimentalMedia/people/YOUR_USERNAME/Week5/openFrameworks/SolLewitt1971`
  - Place `pdf` in folder `ExperimentalMedia/people/YOUR_USERNAME/Week5/openFrameworks/SolLewitt1971/bin/*.pdf`
1.  __Bonus__ Add the ability to modify the program with a potentiometer hooked up to the machine via an arduino.
1.	__Bonus__ Add the ability to generate a new (and different) rendering of the piece each time the spacebar is pressed.
  - Place program in folder `ExperimentalMedia/people/YOUR_USERNAME/Week5/openFrameworks/SolLewitt1971Advanced`
1.  Add all of your programs and output to your fork of our class repository and issue a pull request to me before class begins.
1.  Be able to answer the following questions from memory:
  - What do `int`, `long`, `short` and `byte` have in common?  How are they different?
  - What do `float` and `double` have in common?  How are they different?
  - What does the `unsigned` mean when used with `int`, `long`, `short` and `byte`?
  - What is the function of the `void setup()` function in both openFrameworks and Arduino?
  - What is the function of the `void loop()` in Arduino and `void draw()` in openFrameworks?
  - What is a preprocessor?
  - What is a compiler?
  - What is a linker?
  - What is an IDE?
  - What programming language forms the foundation of both Arduino and openFrameworks?  Who invented the language and when?
1. Remember to work together!
1. Bring your Arduino to class again next week.
1. Check out the following artists / exhibitions.

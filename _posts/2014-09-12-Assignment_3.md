#### Due Week 4
1.  For those of you who are less familiar with Arduino, I highly recommend reading chapters 1 - 4 of "Getting Started with Arduino" (linked in the Syllabus).
1.  Program an Arduino to blink the message `What hath God wrought` in International Morse Code on an LED.  Use one variable to control the length of the `dits` and and one variable to control the length of the `dahs`.  Do not "[hard code](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hard_code)" any numbers in your program, except when assigning variables.
    - Place program in folder `ExperimentalMedia2014/people/YOUR_USERNAME/Week4/Arduino/MorseBasic`
1.  __Bonus__ Modify the Arduino program to encode any arbitrary string in morse code using the LED.
    - Place program in folder `ExperimentalMedia2014/people/YOUR_USERNAME/Week4/Arduino/MorseAdvanced`
1.  Add all of your programs and output to your fork of our class repository and issue a pull request to me before class begins.
1. Remember to work together!
1. Bring your Arduino to class again next week.
1. Check out the following artists / exhibitions.  Come prepared to present work that inspires you:

1. Modify the `HelloWorld` ofSketch example to include acceleration, drag, the bounce factor, and the radius of the ball.  Include the and the boundary fix that we demonstrated in the `update()` loop that we wrote in class.  _Hint: Much of this work basically involves updating the `void update()` method of the `Ball` class to look more like the `update()` method of the example that we developed in class.

1. Attach an image to the particle and make the texture's alignment match the direction of the movement of the particle.  To do this you should look at the `ofVec2f`'s `angle()` method.


1. Extend: Create a custom particle by extending the "Ball" class.  Give it a custom `void draw()` method.

1. Install!
    - The latest version of [ofSketch](https://github.com/olab-io/ofSketch/releases).
        - If you are on a platform other than OSX, talk to me!
    - Install a plain text editor good options:
        - Sublime Text
        - Text Wrangler
2. Set up!
    - Read the [ofSketch](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/ofSketch/chapter.md) chapter of _ofBook_ 
    - Review [terminal commands](https://github.com/olab-io/microWorkshops/blob/master/Terminal_Intro/Terminal_Intro.md)
    - Read the Arduino Intro for your platform [http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).  We'll be starting in with Arduino this week.
3. Command Line Tasks (hint: learn more about command options with `man` - e.g. `man ls`)
    - Download and save this [image](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eCCCdBG4TAM/UXOMfNo981I/AAAAAAAAIe0/MqACCbdjNtk/s320/best+puppies+picture34.jpg) file with `curl`.
    - Change the name of the image file above using `mv`.
    - Make a duplicate of the image file using `cp`.
    - List the contents of your home directory using the _long_ form.  Now do it using `~`.  Now do it printing each file's serial number.
    - Count the number of Presidential orders on the topic of "Fitness" in [this file](https://explore.data.gov/api/views/ps37-i6ce/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) using `curl`, pipes `|`, `wc` and `grep`.  Do it all in a single line.  Confirm your answer using Excel or Google docs.
4. Check out the following artists.  Come prepared to present one of their projects that inspires you:
    - [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com/)
    - [Lillian Schwartz](http://lillian.com/)
    - [Robert Hodgin](http://roberthodgin.com/)
    - [Roman Verostko](http://verostko.com/)
5. Get Equipment - (we will the Arduino during week 3)
    - Acquire an Arduino UNO or newer ( in reality older ones with the Atmega 328 or better will be fine).  Arduino UNOs are available in SAIC resale or in the vending machines.  You are welcome to get a newer Arduino (like a Due), but you probably wonâ€™t need it.  That said. the Leonardo is pretty nice since it can emulate USB devices like a keyboard.  If you want advice about which board to get, post your question at [http://talk.olab.io](http://talk.olab.io).

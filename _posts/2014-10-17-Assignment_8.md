1. Read [Image Processing and Computer Vision](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision/chapter.md) by Golan Levin.  It is an in-progress chapter, but has some useful information about pixels, slitscan, etc which will be good review of class this week.

1. Building on the slitscan example from class, create a slitscan application that allows the user to reposition the slit with the mouse.

1. Extend: Implement multiple slits.  It is up to you to figure out how to render the slits.

2. Extend:  Implement a slit line that the user can position by clicking on two different locations on the source image.
